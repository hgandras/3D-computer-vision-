# 3D computer vision algorithms  
This repository contains 8 3D computer vision algorithms in jupyter notebook. The point of these notebooks is to show the implementations of these algorithms from scratch. and not to invoke them from a python library. The algorithms implemented are the following:

    -Image histogram equalization
    -Image rotation
    -k-means algorithm
    -Undistort radial distortion
    -3D reconstruction
    -Finding epipolar lines
    -RANSAC algorithm for finding lines in the image
    -Iterative Closest Points algorithm for 3D point cloud alignment

These notebooks were written for the 3D Computer Vision lecture held at Charles University by Václav Hlavác.
